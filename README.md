# Project 6 BrevetsRESTFUL
# Author: Freddy Lopez
# 
# Description: 
#			In this project I took the files from the brevets directorty from project 5 and implemented them into the brevets directory 
# of this project. The purpose of this project was to modify the api service used in project 5 in order for the brevets calculator to use flask_restful in order to build a Rest API. In this project, I linked the brevets_api container with brevets and stored data in the backend with a mongo based database. I added the file models.py in order to to create two classes that used mongoengine and would be able to parse through the webpage and pull all the info specified by the user when the user presses submit useing post requests. I also edited flask_brevets.py in order to modify it to work with the new API model and docker-compose.yml file.
