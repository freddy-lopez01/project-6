In this project I implemented a brevet calculation algorithm that calculates when a brevet control point opens and closes. These times are dependent on the total length of the brevet and which section of milage the control brevet is at. Depending at what milage said brevet is at, the rate of speed that is allowed differs and must be calculated slightly differently according to offical brevet rules and guidelines. I was able to obtain data from km and then do the appropriate math in order to get the open and close time to diplay to the webpage
